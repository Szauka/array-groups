# Array Groups (coding test)

After cloning the git repo locally we have to run:

```#!/bin/bash
  npm run install
```

To run the tests we have to run:

```#!/bin/bash
  npm run test
```

To run a specific example we have to edit the `run-example.js` file and then run the following command:

  npm run example
```
